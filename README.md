# Facial-Emotion-Expression-Recognition-with-Developed-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-in-Representation
Compared to the traditional feature extraction and classification method, deep learning method approach is able to extract features from training automatically instead of designing features manually.  In this project, based on the Tensorflow framework, we build a convolutional neural networks (CNN) model for the facial expression recognition task.
